# Emergency Department Optimization 🚑

This project simulates and optimizes patient flow in emergency departments using **SimPy** (for discrete-event simulation) and **Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO)** (for resource optimization).  
It also includes a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive visualization.
